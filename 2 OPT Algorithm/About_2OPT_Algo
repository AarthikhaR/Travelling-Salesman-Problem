2 OPT ALGORITHM

•	2 OPT Algorithm is one of the simple local search algorithms for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem.
•	The main idea of 2OPT Algorithm is that it finds the route that crosses itself and reorder them so that it no longer cross each other.

procedure 2optSwap(route, v1, v2) {
    1. take route[0] to route[v1] and add them in order to new_route
    2. take route[v1+1] to route[v2] and add them in reverse order to new_route
    3. take route[v2+1] to route[start] and add them in order to new_route
    return new_route;
}

repeat until no improvement is made {
    best_distance = calculateTotalDistance(existing_route)
    start_again:
    for (i = 0; i <= number of nodes eligible to be swapped - 1; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j <= number of nodes eligible to be swapped; j++) {
            new_route = 2optSwap(existing_route, i, j)
            new_distance = calculateTotalDistance(new_route)
            if (new_distance < best_distance) {
                existing_route = new_route
                best_distance = new_distance
                goto start_again
            }
        }
    }
}
